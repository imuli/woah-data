# Flight Data Collection

You need an API key to get any data. Follow instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/v1/prereqs).
Put your API key in `.key`.

You have a free quota of 50 queries per day, after which a query costs $0.035.

To collect data for flights to an airport:

	./flights *airport*

Some very simple cost statistics:

	./costs *airport*
