# Flight Data Collection

You need an API key to get any data. Follow instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/v1/prereqs).
Put your API key in `.key`.

You have a free quota of 50 queries per day, after which a query costs $0.035. If you don't have an account yet,
you might be able to use the initial $300 signup bonus to collect everything.

To collect data for flights to an airport:

	./flights {airport}

Some very simple cost statistics:

	./costs {airport}
